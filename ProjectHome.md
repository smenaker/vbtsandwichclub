I'll be the first to admit that this is an extremely imperfect project. I have never used Python or Django before this summer. I have no experience with style sheets, or web app design, or site creation of any magnitude at all. So I'll readily accept any contributions to this project. You'll notice a few concurrency issues, some duplicated code, and a few hacks here and there, so please, help me out!
